SustentaGuia: Facilitating Access to Green Energy Information

SustentaGuia is a lightweight and practical platform designed to share essential knowledge about renewable energy and sustainability. The goal is to make information accessible in a clear and intuitive way, providing insights into solar, wind, and other clean technologies.

What SustentaGuia Offers

Concise and Informative Content: Five key sections with well-structured information about renewable energy and sustainability.

Straightforward User Experience: A simple yet functional frontend built with React, styled with HTML and CSS, and featuring carefully selected visual elements.

Secure Authentication: A basic login system connected to a PostgreSQL database, ensuring controlled access to certain features.

API-Driven Interactions: The app communicates with a Node.js backend to fetch relevant data dynamically.


While the project maintains a clean and minimalistic approach, it serves as a solid foundation for future enhancements, supporting users interested in adopting more sustainable practices.
